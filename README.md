## Short Description of Assignment 1: 
Machine Learning Assignment 1 is done completely using PyCharm IDE. This Assignment mainly focuses on the python lists, tuples, dictionary, sets and a machine learning algorithm K-Nearest Neighbor. We can create lists using square brackets[], tuples using paranthesis(), dictionaries and sets using curly brackets{}. In dictionaries items are stored as key - value pairs. There are many predefined functions in Python to access and modify lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets. In this assignment we used some geometric formulas to calculate area of circle and its circumference.
Implemented KNN Classifier Algorithm and also calculated Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity.

## Short Description of Assignment 2:
Machine Learning Assignment 2 is about implementing the following concepts.
  1.Star Pattern: In this program for loop will be used to generate a pyramid like star pattern as given in the question.
  2.Odd Index Elements: In this program elements at odd indexes have to be printed and it is done by slicing function.
  3.Type of Elements at Given List: In this program the list will cosists of three types of data types by using append() and type() function the output will be displayed
  4.Unique List: In this program a list will be taken as input and return a new list that contains only the unique elements of the original list this is done by removing duplicates from the original list.
  5 Number of Upper and Lower case letters: In this program a string will be given as input and the number of upper and lower case letters is determined by sum(), islower() and isupper() funtion.

## Short Description of Assignment 3:
Machine Learning assignment 3 is about implementing NumPy and Matplotlib. NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more. Matplotlib is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy.
