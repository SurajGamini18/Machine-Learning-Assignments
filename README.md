### University Of Central Missouri


## Short Description of Assignment 1: 
Machine Learning Assignment 1 is done completely using PyCharm IDE. This Assignment mainly focuses on the python lists, tuples, dictionary, sets and a machine learning algorithm K-Nearest Neighbor. We can create lists using square brackets[], tuples using paranthesis(), dictionaries and sets using curly brackets{}. In dictionaries items are stored as key - value pairs. There are many predefined functions in Python to access and modify lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets. In this assignment we used some geometric formulas to calculate area of circle and its circumference.
Implemented KNN Classifier Algorithm and also calculated Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity.

## Short Description of Assignment 2:
Machine Learning Assignment 2 is about implementing the following concepts.
  1.Star Pattern: In this program for loop will be used to generate a pyramid like star pattern as given in the question.
  2.Odd Index Elements: In this program elements at odd indexes have to be printed and it is done by slicing function.
  3.Type of Elements at Given List: In this program the list will cosists of three types of data types by using append() and type() function the output will be displayed
  4.Unique List: In this program a list will be taken as input and return a new list that contains only the unique elements of the original list this is done by removing duplicates from the original list.
  5 Number of Upper and Lower case letters: In this program a string will be given as input and the number of upper and lower case letters is determined by sum(), islower() and isupper() funtion.

## Short Description of Assignment 3:
Machine Learning assignment 3 is about implementing NumPy and Matplotlib. NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more. Matplotlib is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy.

## Short Descreption of Assignemnt 4:
Machine Learning assignment 4 is about classification. Classification in supervised Machine Learning (ML) is the process of predicting the class or category of data based on predefined classes of data that have been 'labeled'. Labeled data is data that has already been classified.

## Short Descreption of Assignemnt 5:
Machine learning assignment 5 is aboutClustering & Dimensionality reduction.
1.PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a technique used in dimensionality reduction that transforms a dataset into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the most important information. The goal of PCA is to identify the principal components of a dataset, which are the directions in which the data varies the most. These principal components can then be used to create a lower-dimensional representation of the data, which can be easier to work with and analyze.
2.Scaling is a preprocessing step used to normalize the features in a dataset. This is important because some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the scale of the features, and can perform poorly if the features are not scaled properly. Scaling can be done using techniques like standardization or normalization, which transform the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, or to be in the range of 0 to 1.
3.The k-means algorithm is a clustering algorithm that partitions a dataset into k clusters based on their similarity. The algorithm works by randomly selecting k initial centroids, and then assigning each data point to the nearest centroid. The centroids are then recalculated based on the mean of the data points in each cluster, and the process is repeated until convergence is reached. K-means is a popular and efficient algorithm for clustering, but it can be sensitive to the initial choice of centroids and can get stuck in local optima.
4.LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification. The goal of LDA is to find a linear combination of features that best separates the classes in a dataset. LDA works by maximizing the ratio of between-class variance to within-class variance, which can lead to better separation of the classes. LDA is commonly used in image and speech recognition applications, where there are many features and few samples.
